# Optimised-Charging-Scheduling-using-Nature Inspired-Metaheuristic-Algorithm-in-WSN
This project implements an optimized charging scheduling system for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) using a nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm, specifically Dynamic Grey Wolf Optimization (DGWO). The primary goal is to efficiently schedule mobile charger paths to recharge sensor nodes, minimizing energy waste and maximizing network lifetime.
